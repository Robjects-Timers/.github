This Organization contains a set of separate repositories relevant to the DIY Timer Assembly builds featured in Youtube video series: "DIY TIMERS".

each repository expressing a unique solution that address the following problem & personal motivation described below:

Problem: Creating a timer that countsdown a pre-selected durations and notifies the user when the countdown reaches zero.

Why I made these: I decided to make these tutorials and repositories from the need to be more productive. Furthermore, I need to take actions towards extremely challenging long-term work goals that I set to accomplish in my life. Taking a good, hard logical assessment of the habitual day-to-day unproductive behavior patterns I do, I shamefully realize that my effort and actions will not yield success and result in failure.

So I need to make a solution that allows engaging in productive active. Better yet, I needed a solution to remove common distractions and temptations that decrease the probability of perpetual effort. If I was. completely honest with myself, I was spending too much time on electronics such as TV, video games and phones that encourage wasted time. Sometimes, even when I am more focused and clear minded, I might reason that I 'need' some actions on my phone such as using timers to maintain concentration, or using productivity apps to measure and view pomodoro sessions which would be a benefit had I not switched to other unproductive habits be following behaviour pre-wired in my brain. Thus, to remove this enticement and falling for the bait, I needed to invent my own solution that removes this option. And by creating this guide through my biggest passion to innovate and share as an engineer, I neurologically partake in healthy, intellectually stimulating activities that solidify and re-wire my brain to do this passin that directly align my self with long-term goals.

These repositories are featured and included as supplementary material for YouTube Channel 'Robjects' which showcase the entire design process. Please feel free to watch the scheduled (estimated in 2025) video series and subscribe to support more these, and other engineering projects I plan to make as I can allow more time spent to the channel.

reduce the temptation of overall distactions when attempting actions that support productivity for long-term goals. 2. To set apart intentional, distraction-free time blocks for self-reflection with minimal stimulation from environment.

Benefits to using guides:

Help to remove overall screen time of from electronics that encourage and reinforcement engagement in distractions (phones, electronics, video games).
Help To lower the overall baseline of dopamine generated for higher durations of mental engagement and focus for activity.
Help To remove the behavior and tendencies to use phones of using phones for a timer, which is unsustainable for those that despite being used as a productiv
